# Problem statement

There is given a rectangular bitmap of size n*m. Each pixel of the bitmap is either white or
black, but at least one is white. The pixel in i-th line and j-th column is called the pixel (i,j). The
distance between two pixels p1=(i1,j1) and p2=(i2,j2) is defined as d(p1,p2)=|i1-i2|+|j1-j2|.
Write a program which:

‚óè Reads the description of the bitmap from the standard input

‚óè for each pixel, computes the distance to the nearest white;

‚óè writes the results to the standard output.

# Input
The number of test cases t (1‚â§t‚â§1000) is in the first line of input, then t test cases follow
separated by an empty line. In the first line of each test case there is a pair of integer numbers
n, m separated by a single space, 1<=n <=182, 1<=m<=182. In each of the following n lines of
the test case exactly one zero-one word of length m, the description of one line of the bitmap, is
written. On the j-th position in the line (i+1), 1 <= i <= n, 1 <= j <= m, is '1' if, and only if the pixel
(i,j) is white.

# Output
In the i-th line for each test case, 1<=i<=n, there should be written m integers f(i,1),...,f(i,m)
separated by single spaces, where f(i,j) is the distance from the pixel (i,j) to the nearest white
pixel.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequests

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) installed on your system.

## üöÄ How to run

Get the code by by cloning the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/umeshchaudhari9/code-challenge.git
```

Once downloaded, open the terminal in the project directory, and install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

To run tests:

```
npm run test
```

To fix lint:

```
npm run lint-fix
```

You can run the program with:

```
cat input.txt | npm run start
```

# Working

If we run the program by running the command it should take the inputs from the input.txt file and should return the output in 
the following format

Output:

3 2 1 0

2 1 0 0

1 0 0 1
